In the reposistory I have made a dynamic sales Dashboard using PowerBI tool
where I have taken the dataset from kaggle,cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
I have used various visulization methods like charts,bargraphs,maps,scliers and maps to create a dynamic dashboard
which will give the user inputs and analysis and help draw results in much more simpler manner rather than going through the data in csv file.
